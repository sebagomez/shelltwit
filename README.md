# shelltwit

shelltwit updates your twitter status while at the command line. 
~~It's a good example of twitter API calls with xAuth.~~ As of Jun-05-2017 it uses [PIN-based](https://dev.twitter.com/oauth/pin-based) authorization

Little more (?) info about it at the original [blog post](http://sgomez.blogspot.com/2010/06/introducing-shelltwit.html)

## Build

The repo contains a single .NET solution, which reference newly created [twitterlib](https://github.com/sebagomez/twitterlib) [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Sebagomez.TwitterLib/).
After downloading the repo just build the sln with Visual Studio 2019 (or higher). You can also use VSCode and use the ./build.sh script for building the project.

This build has been tested on Ubuntu [WSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux), Windows and MacOs, so it [works on my machine](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-works-on-my-machine-certification-program/).  

After building the code just run it as you would usually run a dotnet console app:  
```dotnet
dotnet Sebagomez.Shelltwit.dll
```

For obvious security reasons I don't have the app Key and Secrets embeded in the code. If you want to run the app with your own crdentials you can setup two Environment variables named `TWITTER_API_KEY` and `TWITTER_API_SECRET`. With these, shelltwit will run as your registered twitter app. 

## Docker

In order to build your own container you must run the following command

``` docker
docker run -e "TWITTER_API_KEY=<Your Twitter Key>" -e "TWITTER_API_SECRET=<Your Twitter Secret>" -it --name twit sebagomez/shelltwit 
```

Copy and paste the provided URL in your favorite browser, authorize the app to access twitter on your behalf and copy and paste the provided PIN in the command line waiting for it.

Now you have a container with the needed credentials to access the Twitter API.

We'll now commit those changes into a new image:

``` docker
docker commit twit mytwit
```

And that's it, you can now call commands inside the newly created image as follows:

``` docker
docker run --rm mytwit --help
```

```
